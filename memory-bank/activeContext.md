# Active Context: Crash Game Graph Control

## Current Status
The project is in a functional state with core features implemented:
- CrashEngine calculation system
- CrashGraph visualization component
- Multiple instance demonstration

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup with React and TypeScript
- Implementation of core CrashEngine logic
- Development of CrashGraph rendering component
- Integration of multiple graph instances in index.tsx

## Active Work
The project demonstrates different crash scenarios with predefined crash points:
- 1.1x to 100.0x multiplier range
- Visual representation using canvas
- Real-time animation and updates

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Performance**
   - Animation smoothness
   - Canvas rendering efficiency
   - State management optimization

2. **Visualization**
   - Purple curve rendering
   - Dynamic axis scaling
   - Clear multiplier display

3. **Component Integration**
   - Multiple instance handling
   - Props-based configuration
   - Memory management

## Active Decisions

### Technical Choices
1. **Canvas vs SVG**
   - Using Canvas for better performance with animations
   - Direct pixel manipulation for smooth curves
   - Efficient updates for real-time changes

2. **State Management**
   - Class-based CrashEngine for encapsulation
   - React component state for UI updates
   - Enum-based game state tracking

### Implementation Approaches
1. **Animation**
   - requestAnimationFrame for optimal performance
   - Quadratic curve interpolation
   - Dynamic frame updates

2. **Rendering**
   - Manual canvas context management
   - Explicit cleanup on unmount
   - Responsive to size changes

## Next Steps
1. **Potential Improvements**
   - Performance optimization for multiple instances
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Additional customization options

2. **Future Considerations**
   - Mobile device optimization
   - Additional graph customization
   - Integration with betting systems
