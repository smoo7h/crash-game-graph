# Active Context: Crash Game Graph Control

## Current Status
The project has undergone significant refactoring to improve architecture and maintainability:
- Enhanced CrashEngine with proper encapsulation and interface-driven design
- Improved type safety with dedicated interfaces for configurations
- Updated CrashGraph to use proper getter methods for engine access
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving code structure

## Recent Changes
- Refactored CrashEngine to use private fields and public getters
- Introduced interface-driven configuration:
